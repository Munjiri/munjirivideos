She made great use of a range of film making techniques to highlight the unique features of Embo House and its location, creating an atmosphere which fully chimes with our target clientele. She was innovative and flexible in her approach, but also very focused on getting the detail and message right. Last, but not least, Katy was fun to work with despite the need to complete the project in a short, intense time-frame. We can not recommend her highly enough." <br><br><strong>Ginny Knox , Embo House</strong><br></p>

At the time, we didn’t have a budget for an unplanned video but it was nice to hear about Munjiri Videos. Katy was so thoughtful in emailing to let us know when a few years later she’d be in Zambia, and we realized that we were in a different place and definitely had some video needs! We were able to create a plan for her to visit, and she worked deftly with our team to create a beautiful, thoughtful, and insightful video. We have done a few different videos over the years and this one really captured the essence of the communities we work with and our schools. The footage is the best we have seen from our schools - the colors, images, shots etc. It is amazing that Katy was able to find a compelling story to fit what we needed and we are so grateful for her expertise and time!<br><br><strong>Reshma Patel, Impact Network</strong></p>
